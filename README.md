Asynchronous FIFO Design:

1. The Verilog code implements an asynchronous FIFO, which allows data transfer between two different clock domains (read_clk and write_clk). This is evident in the way we manage read and write operations with separate clock domains.
Double Synchronizers for CDC.

2.The design includes double flip-flop synchronizers for both the write pointer and read pointer (write_pointer_gray_s1, write_pointer_gray_s2, read_pointer_gray_s1, read_pointer_gray_s2). These synchronizers help in transferring pointer values across clock domains and prevent metastability issues associated with clock domain crossing (CDC).
Gray Code Counter:

3.The use of Gray code for the pointers (write_pointer_gray and read_pointer_gray) is implemented to handle the transition of multi-bit signals more reliably. The Gray code helps in reducing the risk of glitches during pointer transitions, which is a standard practice in FIFO designs.
